    "You will execute several important data analysis operations in this assignment. You will count using list methods and organize your results via iteration techniques into dictionaries. You will also practice splitting and summarizing data using NumPy arrays. This assignment therefore lets you practice important data organization techniques and data summary actions. We will use all of these operations later in the semester when we learn how to explore, summarize, and model data.  \n",

    "The first few problems are associated with the Pittsburgh Pirates, the local Major League Baseball (MLB) team in Pittsburgh, PA. The MLB consists of 30 baseball teams. A single game is between 2 teams, a Home team and an Away team. The two teams usually play 3 to 4 games in a row, before changing to different opponents. The consecutive games between the same two teams are referred to as a \"series\" in baseball nomenclature.\n",

Specifically, seven series of games are created and assigned to the `opponents` object in the cell below. The object is created to be easy to visually confirm the number of games within each series against an opposing team. Note that the `\\` character continues the line of code across multiple lines."
